Old code --> Edge smoothening applied explicitly after 100 iterations

New code --> Edge stiffness factored into variational denoising equation

* New reconstructed image looks more realistic and preserve the texture information rather than creating a piecewise constant image
* Many smaller structures are visible in the new reconstruction
* In the older framework, smaller structures are completely lost.
